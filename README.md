#### Project 1: Splitter Contract

    There are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
    we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
    whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
    we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page. Alice can use the Web page to split her ether
